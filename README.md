# Enhanced-Unet-using-Feature-Selection-Methods
**Objective:**

This code aims to enhance the classification of a large bone marrow cell dataset by utilizing an improved U-Net architecture. The goal is to achieve a dual improvement: increasing classification accuracy and reducing computational time. This optimization is attained by incorporating an advanced feature selection method, which effectively identifies the most pertinent features from the dataset, resulting in more efficient and accurate classification.

**Key Features:
**
Enhanced U-Net architecture for improved classification performance
Advanced feature selection method for reduced computational time
Increased classification accuracy and reduced running time
**Significance:
**
This code has the potential to significantly improve the classification of bone marrow cells, which can lead to more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans for patients with bone marrow diseases. it can be accessed through the original source link at https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=101941770
